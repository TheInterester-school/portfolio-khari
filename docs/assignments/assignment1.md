# Assignment 1

# Gonna touch this up later

I’m so sorry, i’m terrible at being present and taking notes simultaneously.

Hunch: How does social media use differ between people creating artistic pieces (i.e. influencers/content creators) and people using social media closer to original intent, i.e. sharing info about your personal life? Does current design favor one over the other?

## Interviewee 1: Dean Payne

Younger brother, creates content on TikTok (so-called “edits”, usually of sports highlight/movies to music). 17, applying to college but not there yet.
This choice may seem a little too college-affiliated or not dissimilar enough, but Dean’s dive into becoming a content creator makes him a great choice for this hunch.

### Questions/starters for Dean:

How often are you posting content on social media? What sort? What got you into this?

### Dean notes: started making edits in March 2024

Says he uses TikTok more since making edits, more analytical viewing edits he likes. Prefers that style of viewing to the more unfocused viewing prior, regrets the increase in social media usage.

## Interviewee 2: Carla Martin

Childhood friend of my mother, has applying to/in college currently. I look to her for the contrast to Dean. Uses social media frequently, but does not create content for others. A “control user” of sorts.

### Potential questions:

What sort of social media do you use? Which is your favorite, and why? Is there anything you’d like to change about your social media usage? Is there anything in particular you’d change about /app/? Why do you prefer /X/ to /Y/? How often do you use /favorite/?

^these tend fairly broad but tbh the prompt is fairly broad.

### Carla Martin Notes:

uses Facebook, Insta, Linkedin, prefers Facebook, ease of use. Familiarity.

Uses Facebook to stay connected with people that she doesn’t see very often

Celebrating birthdays

Political strife.

Posts about vacations, family stuff

Asking for help, trying to raise money/awareness. Has moved away from posting about politics. Got tired of getting into arguments, stopped because job

Facebook – mindless

Wants to cut down

Facebook over instagram due to age demographics

Instagram feed feels unrelated?

### Post-interview analysis:

worried the hunch was a little broad. The observational nature of the prompt plus my desire to keep the conversation natural made it very difficult to come up with pre-interview questions, and the desire to listen fully made it even more difficult to take good notes. I had to take both of my interviews over the phone, as well.

## Dean Interview:

My interview with Dean was really nice! He’s my younger brother, so I was able to keep the interview pretty casual, and mostly avoid any friction around the interview nature of the conversation. Dean was my main point of reference for how a creator would interact with social media, so I was mostly interested in investigating how being a creator might change how one would interact with the platform. As the interview went on, I made sure to ask Dean about his creative process, and was pretty surprised by a statement he made on usage. Dean informed me that, since he began posting content on TikTok, he had actually begun watching TikTok even more than previously. When I asked about why, he told me that he mostly was looking for inspiration; looking at content by people in similar niches and figuring out what made or broke the success of a video. What confused me somewhat was the expression of regret: he said that, despite the fact that his use of the site was more constructive, he still wanted to try and cut down. I can see why he would think that, but I personally believe that if he’s really being honest, TikTok seems like a really good resource to further that. Anecdotal evidence from knowing Dean outside of the interview tells me that this comes from wanting to be a well-adjusted person. He may feel that using TikTok, even if helps him creatively, goes against that. It also doesn’t help that he has college essays due soon.

## Carla Report:

I’ve known Carla for a long time, since she’s known my mother for even longer. As mentioned above, I picked her primarily for the contrast with Dean. I wanted to see how someone who didn’t create content, and indeed was part of an entirely different generation than I was, might choose to interact with social media. One thing I noticed right off the bat was a mistake that I made. A lot more of my questions had binary responses. This definitely hurt the interview the longer it went on, as I didn’t have a great way to come up with a follow-up question. For the most part though, the interview went smoothly. Some main interesting points were that Carla vastly preferred Facebook to any other social media site, saying that she primarily used it to keep in touch with friends. She also pointed out that this led to her speaking politically on the site far less over time, wanting to get into less arguments with people she cared about. She also agreed with my personal experience that using LinkedIn is about the furthest from a fun time that one can get on social media. Contrasting her with Dean, it was interesting to see how she entirely went the opposite route, wanting to only see content on social media from people she knew. One nice story that she gave me that pointed to the contrary however, was from a trip to Japan that she went on. She had recalled one of her friends, who had reposted a story on Facebook about a glass staircase on display. She was able to find it, and it led her to an open-air museum that she really enjoyed. I thought that it was interesting how, even unaware, the ability of social media to connect you to content you never would have known of otherwise could have a positive impact.

## Design Opportunities:

- Friends-only mode

  This is already a feature on several sites, i.e. the Following tab on Twitter/X, but I think it’s important to reiterate how big of a deal this is for people. Social media, for a certain demographic, needs to be a socializing experience, and seeing content from random people and accounts you’ve never heard of can work against that.

- Discovery mode

  Again, this already exists on most services a la your For You tab and so on, but I’m thinking a little broader here. In conjunction with the last suggestion, this could either be a toggleable setting, or a completely discrete section of the website. The idea is that, contrary to friends-only mode, discovery mode aims to give you content/posts from people that you decidedly don’t know, or perhaps less-viewed content. There’s a lot that goes into balancing/integrating this so that, again, people aren’t getting content that they don’t want, but ideation is the first step.

- Reposts are critical

  Both of the interviewees showed just how important it is for users to be able to directly share other users’ content. For Dean, reposts are a key part of how he grows his following. If someone with a large following reposts his content, it naturally ends up being shown to more people, which allows his content to grow faster. For Carla, this allowed her to, even in her more closely-knit circle on Facebook, find a cool landmark she wouldn’t have seen otherwise. I’m considering investigating sites that don’t have reposting tools (e.g. YouTube) and seeing how that changes the experience of users.
